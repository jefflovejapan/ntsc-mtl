#  Scratchpad

## May 23

Looking at the Rust code, the main function is `NtscEffect.apply_effect_to_yiq_field`, which does the following:

1. Generates some initial data structures (width, random seed, "common info", scratch buffer)
2. Applies a luma filter to the yiq field
3. Applies a chroma lowpass filter if enabled
4. Does "chroma into luma" (???) if enabled
...

I think a good first goal is to apply the luma filter to the entire yiq field / frame

### What's going on with filter_plane?

- Uses an IIR (infinite impulse response) filter 
- Called on YIQView
    - Is YIQView the whole field of pixels? Or does it only represent half of the rows because of interlacing?
        - It depends on UseField, it looks like. In most cases (?) this is going to be interlaced.
            - `apply_effect` calls `apply_effect_to_yiq`. We need a YiqField, but this is just an enum that's derived from UseField (identical thing)
            - The default for UseField is .alternating, which gives us either .upper or .lower depending on the timestamp
        - It's only half the 

### Questions for Valerie

- First processing step is `luma_filter` -- it seems like `.Box` just averages the luma across four neighboring pixels in the x dimension. Is that accurate? Any idea why we're only doing it in x, rather than doing a convolution of the 9 pixels in a square or something?
- There are a lot of "delay" parameters but it's not clear that these are actually introducing a temporal delay. Is that the intention? Does the YIQPlane represent multiple frames of data, like a ring buffer?
- It really seems like the alternating upper/lower stuff in YIQView in `apply_effect_to_yiq` was intended to interlace the rows but it looks like it's splitting the whole field into upper and lower parts. Does that sound right?
- What is `filter_signal_in_place` doing?
- Am I correct in assuming that initialCondition::firstSample takes the pixel (luma) value at the first position in the row and uses that for the entire row?

OK, let's look at the outputImage code

```
override var outputImage: CIImage? {
    guard let inputImage else { return nil }
    let prevImage = previousImages.first ?? inputImage
    guard let num = numerators.first else { return nil }
    guard let filteredImage = Self.kernels.filterSample.apply(extent: inputImage.extent, arguments: [inputImage, prevImage, num]) else {
        return nil
    }
    for i in 0..<numerators.count {
        let nextIdx = i + 1
        guard nextIdx < previousImages.count, nextIdx < numerators.count else { break }
        if let img = Self.kernels.sideEffect.apply(extent: inputImage.extent, arguments: [inputImage, filteredImage, numerators[nextIdx], denominators[nextIdx]]) {
            previousImages[i] = img
        }
    }
    return Self.kernels.finalImage.apply(extent: inputImage.extent, arguments: [])
}
```

### Single coefficient

- Let's say 1 numerator/denominator
- On the 0th step, previousImages will be empty, so we'll pass the inputImage twice to filterSample
- The for loop is only going to contain index 0, so index 1 will be out of bounds
- There's no way to maintain state with a single numerator/denominator so the single coefficient case is constant

### Double coefficient

- Let's say 2 numerators/denominators
- On the 0th step, previousImages will be empty, so we'll pass the inputImage twice to filterSample

Input at t0

- First step of the for loop (input 0, index 0):
    - nextIdx (1) is valid
    - we haven't built up previousImages yet so we need to use inputImage0 again I guess?
    - previousImages[0] = f(inputImage0, inputImage0, num[1], den[1])
- Second step of the for loop (input 0, index 1)
    - nextIdx (2) is invalid
    
Input at t1 
    
- First step of the for loop (input 1, index 0):
    - nextIdx (1) is valid
    - we have a previous image now
    - previousImages[0] = f(input 1, previous 0, num[1], den[1])

## Debugging `luma_notch`

- The Rust code uses initialSample, right?
    - Yes, ntsc.rs line 208
- Does initialSample do what I think it does?
    - in `filter_plane_with_rows` we switch on `initial` to get a single float
    - in the case of `firstSample` it's `row[0]` -- does that mean that the same pixel value is used for all pixels in the row?
        - question for Valerie: 
    
- Does the math check out for `luma_notch`?
- Can I write a test that verifies it works the way I expect?
- I think my IIR implementation is wrong. Let's revisit

### `filter_signal_in_place_impl`

```
/// The row of samples
for samp_idx in 0..N {
    // An individual pixel
    let signal = &mut signal[samp_idx];
    // Iterate over the entire sample plus the delay -- why?
    for i in 0..(signal.len() + delay) {
        // guarding that we don't sample out of bounds
        let sample = unsafe { signal.get_unchecked(i.min(signal.len() - 1)) };
        let filt_sample =
            Self::filter_sample(filter_len, num, den, z[samp_idx], *sample, scale);
        if i >= delay {
            signal[i - delay] = filt_sample;
        }
    }
```

If we weren't doing any filtering, we'd be replacing data in the current frame


### Current IIR Filter implementations

- Composite preemphasis
- Chroma lowpass (full and lite)
- Luma notch blur


### Stuff to look into

- MetalKit view (to be sure) âœ…
- testing against Rust values
- better understanding of what the lowpass filters are/should be doing
- What happens if we use SDR video as the input?

- It doesn't matter how many times we feed the same color through the filter, the effect is the same
- We shouldn't see that initial bump in luma though -- what is happening?

- the transfer function is:
    - the arguments for frequency and quality are 0.5 and 2 (same in Rust code)
    - initial condition is firstSample (same in Rust code)
    -   

        let numerators: [Float] = [gain, middleParam, gain]
        let denominators: [Float] = [1, middleParam, (2 * gain) - 1]
- To check floating point error stuff you can just 

Breakthrough!!

- The initial state of the buffers in Rust is *not* equal to the input color. There's something else happening here.
- There's a z[i] for every sample. That means that z needs to be the size of the image. It also means that we should be able to initialize it to some value f(initialCondition, firstSample)
- The size of z is equal to the number of nums/dens (so 4 in this case)
- The `value` argument to `initial_condition` is (I think) the sample/pixel value. 
- `first_nonzero_coeff` is 1 (verified since we know that 1 is the first denominator for our transfer function)
- is `initial_condition` only called sometimes? Why do we have .none, .initialSample, and .constant?
- z[i] just needs to store a value. There are as many zs are there are numerators and denominators. I don't think I need a texture, I just need n zs.
- To set up the initial condition I just fill z up using a function of initialCondition, initialSample, and numerators and denominators
    - It might be possible to parallelize this into a single texture, but that's mega-optimizing. For now we can perform the iteration in initialCondition using CIImages and the initial image
    
## More Rust debugging

- The values I'm getting out of luma blur in Rust still don't match what I'm seeing in Swift -- why?
    - What are the values of z after running the setup for a 0.5 in Rust?
    - What about in Swift?
- The chroma lowpass looks crazy
    - If the initial value is 0/black am I short-circuiting appropriately?
    - What are the values of z after running the setup for a 0.5 in Rust?
    - What about in Swift?

### Is the bug in the initialCondition kernel?

- 
- Swift
    - We call it with image (the input image), initialZ0Image (the z0-filled image), aSum, and cSum
- Rust
    - We call `zi[i] = (a_sum * zi[0] - c_sum) * value;`
    - `value` is 0.5 (our input value / red channel)

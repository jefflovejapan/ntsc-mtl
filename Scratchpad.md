#  Scratchpad

## May 23

Looking at the Rust code, the main function is `NtscEffect.apply_effect_to_yiq_field`, which does the following:

1. Generates some initial data structures (width, random seed, "common info", scratch buffer)
2. Applies a luma filter to the yiq field
3. Applies a chroma lowpass filter if enabled
4. Does "chroma into luma" (???) if enabled
...

I think a good first goal is to apply the luma filter to the entire yiq field / frame
